# QA Automation Challenge - Conclusions

## Overview
The goal of this challenge was to automate both API and E2E tests for the website https://www.demoblaze.com/ using Cypress.

## Implementation Summary

- Cypress was chosen for its modern architecture, support for both UI and API testing, and ease of use.
- The project is structured following best practices: 
  - Clear separation between API and E2E logic
  - Use of Page Object Model for E2E tests
  - Reusable entities for consistent test data
- Tests are grouped into logical folders and can be run independently using npm scripts.
- A custom utility was created for date formatting.

## Test Results

- ✅ **API Tests**: All login and signup scenarios passed successfully.
- ✅ **E2E Flow**:
  - Add 2 products to the cart
  - View the cart
  - Fill out and submit the order form
  - Capture the order confirmation

- ⚠️ **UI Bug Identified**:
  - During the validation of the purchase date in the E2E test, it was found that the date displayed by the site is incorrect.
  - For example, when the test is executed on **13/5/2025**, the site incorrectly shows the date as **13/4/2025**.
  - This issue is visible in the captured screenshot (under the screenshots folder) and seems to be a bug in the application’s frontend logic.

## Final Thoughts

- The project demonstrates a complete solution for both UI and API testing.
- The structure supports scalability for more complex test scenarios.
- Despite the frontend date bug, the test automation is reliable and detects real-world issues.
